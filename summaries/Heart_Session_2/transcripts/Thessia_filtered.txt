================================================================================

[0:01 - 0:05] Oh Jesus Christ, sorry, I just heard that.
[0:05 - 3:23] I don't think Thessia would know what the mistress of the shadow is,
[3:23 - 3:27] so she's probably not going to try and help make a artifact.
[3:57 - 3:58] Ooh.
[3:58 - 9:04] Thessia is probably quickly putting together some sort of light source
[9:04 - 9:11] on a rope to kind of not throw down.
[9:11 - 9:12] Was it?
[9:12 - 9:26] just gently letting it down to see where took place the pittance pittance
[9:26 - 9:44] whatever you call them little pigs pittance sound like something you eat to
[9:44 - 11:19] me okay who's going first doesn't look like anything crawling up or crawling
[11:19 - 11:50] oh okay I'll go first then you guys are useless all right I'm going down do I
[11:50 - 12:05] even know that just I don't know if I would have watched I probably was trying
[12:05 - 12:41] to throw my Latin over the edge I don't think this is very religious okay I will
[12:41 - 13:04] do that difficulty okay all right all right well I guess I can use this
[13:04 - 13:14] ability I can roll mend plus occult to cast this spell on a success for the
[13:14 - 13:20] remainder of the situation you or one nearby ally treats risky actions as
[13:20 - 13:48] standard actions roll plus mend screens doing weird things end plus alt mastery
[13:48 - 14:05] think it's supposed to be ancient magic but I think Sia pulls out something
[14:05 - 14:12] tied around her neck which might be some sort of cog or gear and it's not quite a
[14:12 - 14:28] prayer but it's all a pep talk and she just kinda turns around and abseils
[14:28 - 14:39] down delve plus a cult right okay mastery okay no help I don't know how
[14:39 - 15:28] they're gonna help you say that but it was at a cost okay d6 supplies yeah I
[15:28 - 15:42] got a total of three I've got a total of three streets yes I did oh I get fall
[15:42 - 16:10] out do i okay oh crap i take lab of course let me just check my skills i think it was only fortune
[16:11 - 16:18] fallout that i have yeah it's it's fortune fallout that i um have protection okay
[16:18 - 16:48] okay do I just press the little button on the side and then choose supplies
[16:48 - 20:05] okay roll okay well gosh darn it a six okay on roll high
[20:05 - 20:29] freaking damn it dropped it stupid wind this place is cursed
[20:29 - 20:54] ah it's okay you probably none of that you've got i'll just you go in front and then i mean
[20:54 - 21:02] your eyes are better than mine anyway aren't elf eyes better elfie eyes better pretty sure
[21:23 - 21:33] well how about i borrow your lantern and then when we're done i'll pass it back to you
[21:33 - 22:19] oh god oh dear god
[24:30 - 26:18] it was a major yeah oh yeah yeah no wait Werther's sorry it was Werther's wasn't it
[26:21 - 26:33] this here shakes shakes oh maybe you sprung a leak i kind of look around
[26:33 - 26:59] Eh, let's just curse this place. Really means that it could be. Oh maybe we'll find some on the way.
[27:00 - 27:51] Look at how many ropes have broken, she points out. I mean they could have two legs each.
[28:22 - 31:15] Fresh-ish looking. Okay who's gonna loot the body? You wanna look? Hey you found any oil?
[31:15 - 37:15] I guess that makes sense. Worthers could smell something. Have a go, like, ask is it on the way
[37:15 - 38:30] to this, was it the spine? I suppose you can smell if there's any oil there. Yeah my concern
[38:30 - 38:38] is if there's so much stuff there that someone's been collecting stuff and may not take too kindly.
[38:38 - 39:05] to others sniffing around well I guess if it's not too much of a diversion oh let's just keep
[39:05 - 39:18] going and see what happens this year we'll try and collect as much rope as possible even strands
[39:18 - 41:51] of rope that's fallen if it's of okay strength and not too decayed yep
[41:51 - 43:42] Well I think we're on the right, well I think we're on the right path.
[43:42 - 43:52] I'm just looking through my notes what Larissa told us and it was tunnels become like bones
[43:52 - 44:03] and there's a place in the tunnels you can't miss the scripted walls, anyway, I show the
[44:03 - 44:14] warning to the others well that what's written cut and then she ponders how a wall
[44:15 - 44:47] like is it made of pieces of bone or just feels like the whole surface is bone okay what does it
[44:47 - 46:29] mean silence is golden is it making any not sorry i was just gonna ask is it making yeah okay
[46:29 - 54:35] So Fessia is recalling what Larissa said um is there I don't know whether this would be
[54:35 - 54:51] help but a couple of bees start coming out of Fessia's jacket somewhere and I want to
[54:51 - 54:59] I want to see if I the bees can kind of cover some of those words that are being
[54:59 - 55:14] scrawled I don't know it yeah like if it if she sees it certain words are
[55:14 - 55:23] obscured to make it look like like it's saying for her to go back go back to
[55:23 - 55:30] silence whether some of those, I don't know how, depends what it's written, to change,
[55:30 - 55:54] to omit some of the words to say, oh okay, maybe buzzing in your ear and saying something else.
[56:11 - 56:19] I think it's more pulling away, I think, or changing what's written, saying that,
[56:19 - 1:05:18] to go back so it's probably not helping you really in that sense okay um does it interest this here
[1:05:20 - 1:05:35] I don't think but I don't like what did what did Larissa say originally uh that the script was
[1:05:35 - 1:05:40] written writing about me things that happened to me that I remembered but then writing things
[1:05:40 - 1:05:49] that hadn't happened to me but maybe will happen okay does it actually did
[1:05:49 - 1:06:38] it actually have Arcadia's name on the wall hmm probably not the time to
[1:06:38 - 1:06:43] interrogate her that Thessia will quickly scroll whatever she could
[1:06:43 - 1:06:50] remember from the letter as you kind of see a whole bunch of bees buzzing
[1:06:50 - 1:07:14] around her and then disappear in her coat. I don't see that. Thessia doesn't see that.
[1:07:14 - 1:07:34] What, that I'm writing something in my book? Because it's also, you probably
[1:07:34 - 1:07:47] would know Thessia is an engineer slash scientist slash weirdo from a place
[1:07:47 - 1:07:57] you've probably never been because she's not from the city or and you've made snap judgments
[1:07:57 - 1:08:14] nap judgments of her culture oh yeah you can't see behind the mask but Thestia does not see you
[1:08:14 - 1:08:45] looking disapprovingly at her. Right we're done writing on the walls sorry what what's that sorry
[1:08:45 - 1:09:23] what was that oh okay here and the bit about roots going up and leaves going down
[1:09:23 - 1:09:35] which originally was leaves go up and roots go down but then the dream it
[1:09:35 - 1:09:41] doesn't so it said leaves go up roots go down originally but then as it was
[1:09:41 - 1:15:23] writing about Arcadia's dream it reversed itself okay yes let's see it
[1:15:23 - 1:16:38] turns around at that comment the question about the spine are we heading
[1:16:38 - 1:16:45] towards her head or towards the hips? Okay.
[1:16:45 - 1:20:03] Thessia smiles because she was feeling left out that she couldn't hear her own voice.
[1:20:03 - 1:20:16] I've checked my pockets if I do have any more acorns from this morning.
[1:20:16 - 1:20:37] Is it the same direction? Thessia is like annoyed that someone's pinched her
[1:20:37 - 1:20:44] voice well again without her permission I just remembered about that just now
[1:20:44 - 1:20:57] and in a confident like almost like a yeah just annoyed stomp towards that
[1:20:57 - 1:27:15] direction all right who the fuck has taken my voice again is it coming for us
[1:27:15 - 1:27:26] actually I turn around turn around to see if the Arcadia and worth those kind
[1:27:26 - 1:27:32] of half turning but also keeping an eye on this bird kind of silently whisper
[1:27:32 - 1:27:47] not whispering but through gritted teeth your dream
[1:27:47 - 1:33:59] Oh definitely shoot it then. Worth shooting Arcadia. What happens with the
[1:33:59 - 1:39:11] expensive? Was it risky? Does it take away the highest? I mean part of me just wants to
[1:39:11 - 1:39:15] quickly get my notebook and write down what the hell just happened to the ATR.
[1:39:21 - 1:39:33] But now she's gone really close to the things so that complicates things because actually I'm not
[1:39:33 - 1:39:52] under threat am I it hasn't come no all right all right so um i mean i don't know really what i'm
[1:39:52 - 1:42:52] gonna do um all right you go do because because this is really confused right now i thought she
[1:42:52 - 1:44:41] wanted to find the bird not kind of eat it i mean i might end up hurting katia which is not
[1:44:42 - 1:45:07] um I don't know what this does I have a something called a hive tool oh I don't
[1:45:07 - 1:45:16] know it says it's got a kill tag okay all right
[1:45:16 - 1:45:22] okay yeah yeah I guess I will get closer and I'm kind of yelling at worth are we
[1:45:22 - 1:45:28] trying to kill this thing what's going on and then see worth shoot it a second
[1:45:28 - 1:45:36] in her head and Thessia's, not Thessia, Arcadia's has pulled some knife or
[1:45:36 - 1:45:45] clawed thing from her and trying to stab it okay and Thessia pulls out some sort of
[1:45:45 - 1:45:52] strange looking tool I don't even know what it would look like at this stage
[1:45:52 - 1:46:02] it's probably got some sort of hook and I mean I think she's shorter than all of
[1:46:02 - 1:46:08] you so she's kind of maybe trying to kick off against one of these bone
[1:46:08 - 1:46:19] staglomites to kind of jump up and stab wildly at the air where the bird is.
[1:46:19 - 1:46:48] I don't have kill is this risky okay I don't think I don't think it works like
[1:46:48 - 1:46:58] that because I've got another skill that spins out swarms of bees yep so in that
[1:46:58 - 1:47:11] case I'm going to chant the hive tool to use this can I use it again to change
[1:47:11 - 1:47:21] risky actions to standard actions for this situation okay which is a yep mend
[1:47:21 - 1:48:06] plus a cult at a cost is it fortune I don't know okay echo oh crap oh this is
[1:48:06 - 1:56:22] great oh god I think it was if it was just a blink and I'm not really noticing
[1:56:22 - 1:56:29] anything else are we gonna try and hit this thing with my tool which doesn't do
[1:56:29 - 1:56:40] much but anyway um so I roll I don't have kill it's now standard but what did
[1:56:40 - 1:57:10] you say cursed okay that's fine so it's got a tag called brutal and I quickly
[1:57:10 - 1:57:22] quickly looked it up and it said roll two dice and pick the highest 2d for
[1:57:22 - 1:57:47] keep highest what happened oh whoops nope what's the keep highest oh okay I
[1:57:47 - 1:58:04] no space oh four damage yeah okay you see Vesia after talking to her tool jump
[1:58:04 - 1:58:14] up like I said runs and leaps off as stalagmite and just yeah try and reach
[1:58:14 - 1:58:24] this bird in I'm gonna say what might pass for its heart like it's like it's a
[1:58:24 - 1:58:30] small tool I think it might have just went through a gap of a rib at the right
[1:58:30 - 1:58:39] spot and just kind of hook it and I don't know maybe maybe it gets hooked
[1:58:39 - 2:01:03] that the heart gets pulled out of its chest as the bird falls down or something like that
[2:01:03 - 2:01:34] can i get my tool please wait hang on are you are you holding my tool oh yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna
[2:01:34 - 2:01:40] like like not not like quickly but i'm going like i'm just i'm just gonna just i'm just gonna take
[2:01:40 - 2:01:45] that like not the heart you could have the heart just just the thing sticking out of the heart
[2:01:45 - 2:02:10] okay yeah bees will start buzzing or you hear the sound of bees as Thessia's hand
[2:02:10 - 2:02:19] kind of reaches towards the tool it's just low movements no sudden movements
[2:02:19 - 2:03:01] pluck the tool out I think at some point was it you yeah it was you that
[2:03:01 - 2:03:07] Thessia did see something horrible with Arcadia present in her I think was one
[2:03:07 - 2:03:15] those questions that we had yet so unless this unless this thing that has
[2:03:15 - 2:03:22] overtaken Arcadia is threatening me like she's just going to be cautious and keep
[2:03:22 - 2:03:28] her bees buzzing but she wants her tool back because that's very very important
[2:03:28 - 2:07:44] to her. Unless Arcadia took it. Do I still have that darkness fallout or did
[2:07:44 - 2:11:47] Werther's take her? Or did this place is cursed? After Thessia has gotten her
[2:11:47 - 2:11:54] tool back, she, like with all the blood, is it red blood or some other color
[2:11:54 - 2:12:10] blood. I don't think anyone sees it because Wirth is packing up his bag
[2:12:10 - 2:12:16] and Arcadia is looking at this heart and flickering. But the bees will clean
[2:12:16 - 2:12:39] the hive tool for her as she puts it in her pocket afterwards. They're fed for a
[2:12:39 - 2:12:46] while and she's got to get her notebook out and write observations on Arcadia
[2:12:46 - 2:12:57] and there's a question at the last sentences is she gonna eat the heart
[2:12:57 - 2:19:28] question mark no because I will roll a one like I do with all these Dells if I
[2:19:28 - 2:20:10] roll a one don't shoot me with that unreliable rifle they initiated it not
[2:20:10 - 2:22:25] me independent yeah I'm like did I'm just trying to think back did I sign
[2:22:25 - 2:22:44] something would I have I think I said I'll read it and get back to you what
[2:22:44 - 2:23:05] were you asking me sorry am I threat unless she tries to kill me or still my
[2:23:05 - 2:23:08] heart as she's looking at the pocket you've
[2:23:08 - 2:23:31] probably pocketed in right yeah i'm not quite familiar with
[2:23:31 - 2:23:56] this i incarnate in oh i will have to check my schedule
[2:23:56 - 2:24:00] but i will take a note of that and i open up my book and say
[2:24:00 - 2:24:09] um write down something uh like worth is believes in a god
[2:24:09 - 2:24:35] name in khan name what was it okay uh yeah i will just put it in the long list of to-do lists
[2:24:36 - 2:24:50] i have in the back of my book i also wonder um is the tree any different after the bird was killed
[2:24:50 - 2:25:17] well would you look at that the roots do go up does it look like branches are
[2:25:17 - 2:26:08] going down and you saw this in your dream Arcadia this is looking at that
[2:26:08 - 2:26:28] pretty little head of yours wait hang on have you turned back yet no okay all
[2:26:28 - 2:26:33] okay if you will make a note make sure Carrie hearts with her next time we go
[2:26:33 - 2:28:49] and a delve it must mean something it's probably not the tree but that bird dead
[2:28:49 - 2:29:06] but undead bird have to feel anything but your actions may help with whatever
[2:29:06 - 2:29:52] you're seeking you certainly had a desire to kill it huh no you have your
[2:29:52 - 2:30:01] own beliefs. My mind makes theories. Now I've forgotten what I was going to say.
[2:30:02 - 2:30:20] What were we talking about? Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. I mean I'll listen. Doesn't mean
[2:30:20 - 2:32:08] I'm gonna rationalize your beliefs into mine. I was just about to think that. I'm just watching
[2:32:08 - 2:33:16] the stirring contest yeah i would like that mark you put down on me for disappearing
[2:33:18 - 2:33:28] erased please hang on this was out of character
[2:33:29 - 2:33:37] because i wouldn't i wouldn't have seen this or anything no you don't know how this works
[2:33:37 - 2:33:47] Who doesn't have an open mind now? Maybe I needed to disappear to be able to kill this thing.
