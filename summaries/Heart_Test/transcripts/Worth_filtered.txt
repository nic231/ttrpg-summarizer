================================================================================

[3:13 - 3:33] I have neither the skill nor the domain.
[3:33 - 6:18] Yes, also, it is not the one true religion of Fink, aren't I?
[6:18 - 6:27] I'm probably just watching Arcadia with some curiosity.
[6:27 - 6:33] I mean, I also feel like I have to ask the classic question,
[6:33 - 6:44] were these wards put to keep something out or something in...
[6:44 - 6:51] I don't know how I, is there any way I can determine that?
[6:51 - 6:53] I'm not very good at that.
[6:53 - 6:58] I may just have to, do I care enough?
[6:59 - 7:03] Probably not, I'm really just here to do a job.
[7:03 - 7:12] So I suppose to answer your question, I'm not doing much.
[7:12 - 7:12] That's true.
[7:12 - 7:16] I mean, if anyone was gonna have brought our rope
[7:16 - 7:19] and such along, it would probably be me,
[7:19 - 7:21] in which case I will, yeah.
[7:21 - 7:55] Do I like mark supplies off if I wanna have brought?
[7:55 - 7:56] Okay.
[7:56 - 8:04] So would it just be a Del role? I don't have any particular skill unless Thessia has some sort of skill and I'd be happy to help her.
[8:04 - 20:16] I also have nothing in Del.
[20:16 - 20:27] Thessia, your lantern appears to be running low. Was it damaged?
[20:27 - 20:36] Well, I'm not sure if that's so, but you're certainly our eyes and ears down here.
[20:36 - 20:45] You are welcome to some of my lantern oil if you wanted.
[20:45 - 21:11] oh no i insist that's a harmless positive stereotype um i mean
[21:13 - 21:18] i really would feel more comfortable with you in front you are yeah the most skilled of us in these
[21:18 - 21:40] kind of situations and i have oil to spare sure uh can i roll a d6 to try and remove this darkness
[21:40 - 21:55] oh god i mean what's really funny is i've got a skill that lets once per session lets me
[21:55 - 21:59] shunt stress off to the nearest friendly target so i could shunt it back onto the
[22:01 - 23:05] but i'm not gonna do that oh five six you said roll six right i'll just roll it again
[23:07 - 23:43] if you want there you go roll it roll the six you said all righty uh do you want me to press
[23:43 - 24:14] the button or you pick one okay well you go with i took the stress off already this i don't know if
[24:14 - 26:24] that messes with the calculation cool yes yes i'm i'm sure i had some more oil in here somewhere
[26:24 - 26:52] and he's like rooting through his pack most inconvenient well well it's certainly inconvenient
[26:52 - 28:50] to be navigating without oil um perhaps either of these fellows remember to pack their oil
[28:50 - 31:42] anything valuable sorry well sure I can help you find the right buyer when we
[31:42 - 32:04] return to silence but by right of salvage that is yours um the thought
[32:04 - 32:12] occurs to earth with these people being down here so it starts to think why why
[32:12 - 32:21] are they down here I have an ability you do once possession asked the DM where
[32:21 - 32:28] nearest source of wealth is and they will tell you. Now I don't know if that's sort of supernatural
[32:28 - 32:53] and that I can sniff out wealth. What's your thought Brendan? Okay maybe I will start thinking
[32:53 - 32:58] about it and if it's your point where you think it would be narratively interesting to give me
[32:58 - 34:07] that information then that is sort of the moment that it coalesces. Well there are certainly some
[34:07 - 34:26] things down here that are worth salvaging I can smell shall we push on oh that's interesting like
[34:28 - 34:43] newly tanned leather fresh paint polished silver maybe each has its own distinct dota but
[34:43 - 34:50] may not necessarily be aligned with what that thing is.
[34:50 - 35:33] It's an art, more than a science.
[35:33 - 37:24] Ah, the sweetest smell of all.
[37:24 - 37:27] Certainly seems to be in this direction, yes.
[37:27 - 37:32] I'll let you know if we go past it.
[37:32 - 37:49] One would hope that it aligns with our goals rather than needing to sidetrack.
[37:49 - 37:52] Unfortunately not, as I said.
[37:52 - 37:53] It's an art.
[37:53 - 38:25] It seems a reasonable assumption, but perhaps we're best to push on and see if we can find
[38:25 - 38:47] it before what little oil we have burns out.
[38:47 - 38:55] Certainly a possibility, it may equally likely be traps of some kind, we should certainly
[38:55 - 38:56] keep our eyes peeled.
[38:56 - 43:13] Sorry, did you say silence or violence?
[43:13 - 43:14] This is important.
[43:14 - 43:17] Silence, okay, okay, I heard violence.
[43:17 - 49:12] Just that we should proceed with as little noise as possible.
[49:12 - 49:41] Arcadia, Arcadia, then is it wise to give them away so freely?
[49:41 - 54:09] Perhaps move your hand from the wall.
[54:09 - 54:15] Arcadia, really feel it would be in your best interest for us, for you to let us pull you
[54:15 - 54:26] back from that wall and I'll look at this here.
[54:26 - 54:29] I don't want us to be making the check Nicole, I just want to set up for what happens if
[54:29 - 56:29] it goes good or bad. I'm getting ready to pull you away but only after your thing has been resolved.
[1:02:07 - 1:03:18] Are you well? Then we would be wise not to give it any further chances to do so.
[1:03:18 - 1:03:27] Incarnate teaches we should give nothing away without expecting something in return.
[1:03:48 - 1:03:58] It likely has something worth protecting. That has been my experience, something that might be
[1:03:58 - 1:04:28] valuable to us. And silence. Yeah where's that money
[1:04:28 - 1:04:35] smell coming from? I'm not giving that thing anything for
[1:04:35 - 1:05:08] free. Not my business so I'm not even really going to read it
[1:05:08 - 1:05:22] but it might interest this here because you're always creeping around
[1:05:22 - 1:07:04] Arcadia. Yeah Worth will give you a bit of a like
[1:07:04 - 1:07:07] a disapproving look as if you're doing something really
[1:07:07 - 1:07:15] quite dirty. Yeah well he won't say anything he'll just give you
[1:07:15 - 1:07:23] like a scowl. I mean if you're looking at the wall and writing he
[1:07:23 - 1:07:58] can probably infer that you're writing that down. That's Arcadia's property.
[1:07:58 - 1:08:19] Hey it's true. It has a little like hinge thing that
[1:08:19 - 1:08:34] controls the eyebrows and you can wheel them up and down. Yes
[1:08:34 - 1:08:43] let's move forward quietly although perhaps we can't trust that.
[1:08:43 - 1:08:48] But I do smell that the silence is golden.
[1:08:51 - 1:08:56] But I can still smell that wealth somewhere nearby.
[1:08:59 - 1:09:01] I'm assuming I can, Brendan, if I can't let me know.
[1:09:07 - 1:09:09] We are getting closer.
[1:09:28 - 1:09:31] I mean, at least this wall understands perspective.
[1:09:31 - 1:09:36] So, you know, it's got some admiration.
[1:09:36 - 1:13:43] I hardly think this is the time to reignite that discussion.
[1:13:43 - 1:14:57] Although, uh, and Worth will put like his hand on his revolver and be looking around.
[1:14:57 - 1:15:04] I'm sure that this has piqued your curiosity as it has mine, but it appears this thing
[1:15:04 - 1:15:09] can only work with what we've given it.
[1:15:09 - 1:15:19] Perhaps if we simply ignore it and move on, we may render it powerless.
[1:15:19 - 1:15:23] Or it could stab us in the back.
[1:15:23 - 1:15:44] Hard to say.
[1:15:44 - 1:16:16] Damn it.
[1:16:16 - 1:17:45] Weird room slash wall owes me one. Well it is clearly trying to disorient or spook us.
[1:17:49 - 1:18:04] Let's not fall prey to these tricks. Let's push on. This leviathan and worth a look at the skeleton.
[1:18:06 - 1:18:59] Have either of you ever seen such a creature? No. Um would there be
[1:19:00 - 1:19:14] any kind of mythological creatures we might have heard of or or is it just a real big snake? Fair
[1:19:14 - 1:19:44] enough. I must say I find it somewhat more unnerving than whatever mind games this place
[1:19:44 - 1:21:26] is trying to play. And it's true you really could go for some acorns. This place gets me.
[1:21:26 - 1:21:35] The devil you know and all that. Worth will come with you guys. Love that Worth and Thessia seem
[1:21:35 - 1:30:02] really uh interested on protecting our branding for this grip well i'm gonna draw my gun train
[1:30:02 - 1:30:13] it on this thing and pull back that hammer because it's like a filigree revolver so you
[1:30:13 - 1:32:15] would all probably hear that click yeah i mean it is coming right for us yeah like if it if it
[1:32:15 - 1:32:20] springs and it looks like it's not just flying up and away it's like flying straight at us then yes
[1:32:20 - 1:33:05] I can't really do anything awesome that's not to the detriment of my companions. I do have kill
[1:33:05 - 1:33:26] though. Domain is cursed and difficulty is standard. Yep I do but it's for delve or discern
[1:33:26 - 1:34:03] checks. Blam my revolver does a d8. It is expensive though so if I roll max damage I take
[1:34:03 - 1:34:45] d6 stress to supplies I think also sorry it might just take an additional stress
[1:34:45 - 1:34:53] yeah from my um my debtors reds the robes you may automatically cause one
[1:34:53 - 1:42:46] stress to an adversary who can see you each time you act I mean I know what I'm
[1:42:46 - 1:43:05] gonna do yeah look worth is he'll be in the same spot he will be appear to be
[1:43:05 - 1:43:11] relatively calm even with Arcadia's transformation if she wants to turn into
[1:43:11 - 1:43:15] some sort of unknowable hell beast that's her business and nothing to do
[1:43:15 - 1:43:24] with me so yeah you'll hear that hammer cock back again and worth will fire at
[1:43:24 - 1:52:56] this bird yeah it's a four total with my rope yes same old same old hammer back
[1:52:56 - 1:54:00] again this is a magic revolver so this is roll stress yeah d6 roll five oh hang
[1:54:00 - 1:54:06] on to IO I was manually giving myself stress let's not do that and then click
[1:54:06 - 1:54:12] heart because that'll double. Okay pick a resistance to take stress in supplies.
[1:54:13 - 1:55:19] Roll and now fall out. You and I have different definitions of perfect Brendan. I've really
[1:55:19 - 1:56:50] planned this trip poorly. Oh sorry Brendan can I do one damage to it because I acted?
[1:56:51 - 2:04:11] Just in case that happens to be the straw that kills it. Freezing. Yeah um so Worth has not
[2:04:11 - 2:04:18] engaged in any of this because he has taken his pack off meticulously put every item out on the
[2:04:18 - 2:04:27] ground and he's checking like against a list in his ledger um and appears to be becoming quite
[2:04:27 - 2:04:40] frustrated but it is completely taking his attention damn right they should be there i do
[2:04:40 - 2:05:11] not make mistakes like this uh that's you know that's honestly at this point more disturbing than
[2:05:11 - 2:05:23] and the interdimensional beast that is Arcadia.
[2:05:23 - 2:05:28] Yeah, yep, yep.
[2:05:28 - 2:05:30] Yeah, if you look back, that's what you'll see.
[2:05:30 - 2:05:33] Yeah, he appears to be growing more and more frustrated
[2:05:33 - 2:08:08] looking at this like pile of stuff and back at his ledger.
[2:08:08 - 2:08:12] I think basically we swapped lanterns for this period,
[2:08:12 - 2:08:15] but I also didn't have extra lantern fuel,
[2:08:15 - 2:08:16] which I expected to have.
[2:08:16 - 2:09:14] So, well, he will have pulled his pack back together.
[2:09:14 - 2:09:18] um although he's quite meticulous in the packing so
[2:09:18 - 2:09:25] it would take a little while um but once he's done that he'll come over
[2:09:25 - 2:09:30] point up towards the items that he can see
[2:09:30 - 2:10:13] there these are what i smelled where is that smell of desperation coming
[2:10:13 - 2:10:30] from there doesn't appear to be like one that
[2:10:30 - 2:10:33] that looks like it could still be alive or
[2:10:33 - 2:10:43] They're all looking pretty dead. Well I just wondered what else would produce like desperation.
[2:10:48 - 2:10:53] Okay well that works too and also the smells the smells don't really match the thing
[2:10:53 - 2:11:27] so it doesn't have to be that they did. Well as laid out in our group charter
[2:11:28 - 2:11:36] findings and salvage are to be divided equally. Let's get up there and see what we can find.
[2:11:36 - 2:17:39] I'll be looking at Thessia when I say let's. Certainly do. Okay, loot is to be divided. Who
[2:17:39 - 2:20:13] wants a gun? Well, Thessia did the killing blow so. There you go, that's not a one. Yep, good to know.
[2:20:13 - 2:20:26] violence gets rewards. Violence is golden! Well, before we proceed, there are a couple
[2:20:26 - 2:20:33] of administrative matters to take care of. Firstly, I believe this place is
[2:20:33 - 2:20:46] cursed in some way. My supplies do not match my ledger. I do not make mistakes
[2:20:46 - 2:20:53] stakes like that. Be cautious about relying on anything you think you might
[2:20:53 - 2:21:06] have. The second would be the duality of your nature Arcadia. Does this pose any
[2:21:06 - 2:21:21] threat to Thessia or myself? I have conducted a thorough assessment of my
[2:21:21 - 2:21:33] own nature and concluded that I am a net benefit to the group. I have no issue
[2:21:33 - 2:22:06] you with this change but it just may need to be reflected in the team charter and your word is
[2:22:06 - 2:22:17] good enough for me no change to the charter is required thessia i'm not sure you guys would have
[2:22:17 - 2:22:27] ever read this charter that worth keeps referring to there's something that he's like i mean he
[2:22:27 - 2:22:52] would have certainly asked you to that's up to you whether or not arcadia's quirks were going to
[2:22:52 - 2:23:25] be any issue for you." Well, she has given her word that she won't, and incarnadine comes for those
[2:23:25 - 2:23:39] who break their word. Yes, well, he goes by many names, sometimes incarnae, which, you know, I
[2:23:39 - 2:23:48] shouldn't mess up, given that I'm a priest. Well, when we return to silence, perhaps you would
[2:23:49 - 2:24:17] like to come to one of my services. incarnae, sorry, I have a tip in my mouth.
[2:24:17 - 2:29:26] incarnate i-n-c-a-r-n-e. Meaning is not inherent. It is something we create for ourselves.
[2:29:28 - 2:29:36] Means no more than whatever you want it to mean. It is nothing more than what it is.
[2:29:46 - 2:30:12] Perhaps a sermon would benefit you, Thessia. Rationality. I would have thought you would have
[2:30:12 - 2:30:48] been amenable to the idea. All I ask is that you keep an open mind. I keep an ordered mind.
[2:30:48 - 2:31:04] No, it's better. I am confident and assured in my beliefs. I only wish to share them with others
[2:31:04 - 2:31:53] for their benefit. Indeed, as that is what I am, and nothing more. Um, it's probably just as well
[2:31:53 - 2:31:57] that worth is wearing that mask because he's probably a little bit creeped out by that but
[2:31:57 - 2:32:14] he doesn't want to give that away so i mean that's the great thing about these masks you
[2:32:14 - 2:32:20] cannot lose a staring contest i suppose they have to have eye holes now that i think
[2:32:23 - 2:32:32] it was it was not a lack of lamp oil at all i'm like it's really dark in here
[2:32:58 - 2:33:23] yes well fought job well done i just see what we can find for the benefit of silence but you
[2:33:23 - 2:33:38] abandoned the group at a critical moment? No, you wouldn't have. I'm glad you picked up on what it was for though.
[2:33:42 - 2:33:58] Dereliction of duty. The marks will stay as they are.
