================================================================================

[0:04 - 1:21] creepy
[1:25 - 1:29] If if we can see these kind of like religious sigils everywhere
[1:31 - 1:34] Would it be possible for me to fashion
[1:36 - 1:38] something in the sign of
[1:38 - 1:40] our mistress of shadow
[1:41 - 1:50] To add to the wall. I mean look
[1:52 - 1:54] If flavors re
[1:55 - 1:57] What have I got in my shade? I don't know whether it gives me much
[1:58 - 2:09] I mean shit if the mistress is watching, which would be hard down here, but we could do with a bit of help.
[2:09 - 3:47] That's fair, let's see what happens. Is it just a standard difficulty?
[3:47 - 5:24] Well yeah, so I guess yeah maybe while the other two are kind of in you know investigating the
[5:24 - 5:28] descent and trying to work out how best to get down yeah Arcadia would have
[5:28 - 5:34] noticed these these symbols kind of like stuck into the wall and would have just
[5:34 - 5:39] you know with various bits and pieces like chicken bones and stuff that she
[5:39 - 5:43] has in her pack or whatever just started like weaving together this little
[5:43 - 5:50] little sigil. Not telling anybody specifically what she's doing but yeah
[5:50 - 5:57] Yes she's not being sneaky about it either, she would just be working away and then embed it in
[5:57 - 11:33] the wall next to where they are standing. I mean I can, I have nothing in dove.
[11:41 - 11:53] I just got us religiously blessed from a moon goddess, so you're welcome. I mean it depends,
[11:53 - 11:57] it depends whether Arcadia, it depends whether like this here was watching Arcadia enough to see the,
[11:57 - 22:07] and I assume that possibly Thessia wouldn't know what the symbol is does
[22:07 - 27:06] this place feel cursed oh dear I don't think it's cursed not really hmm
[27:06 - 27:49] that's a fair point are there any bodies on the ground but only two legs yeah
[27:49 - 28:59] yeah look I mean like look yeah I mean I guess like Arcadia is not squeamish is she
[28:59 - 29:08] here you would probably observe Arcadia like hmm maybe far too comfortably
[29:08 - 29:14] looting that body like checking all the pockets checking all the hidden pockets
[29:14 - 29:19] like emptying out packs and stuff as if it's if it's no thing as if she's done
[29:19 - 31:29] this quite a few times before. Curious. No oil as for valuable perhaps for the
[31:29 - 31:53] right buyer and I'll sort of cast a look at worth. These two have been
[31:53 - 35:43] searched before I would wager there is not much left what do they smell like
[35:43 - 38:03] it is not unreasonable to assume that these valuables belong to more
[38:03 - 38:12] unfortunate explorers yes so perhaps there will be some spire
[38:12 - 44:28] whatever it's called, by a black whale. There's someone who's like carved this into the surface.
[44:36 - 47:35] That would have taken some effort. Yeah we missed all of that. I step forward at that
[47:39 - 47:48] and I am going to I guess like trace a finger along the words as they're appearing.
[47:48 - 49:03] I will probably at this point just be standing transfixed watching the script
[49:03 - 49:22] even though I know what the next word will be. These words are known to me
[49:22 - 49:56] these words are for me and only me. I'm actually just gonna leave it there to
[49:56 - 49:59] see what happens because like I'm assuming they're getting towards the end of the
[49:59 - 51:57] the letter like what happens when it reaches the letter's end. Yeah I mean it
[51:57 - 52:12] yeah I look I think the the two of you like are going to see well you will see
[52:12 - 52:20] like a like a tear run down Arcadia's face but because she is a blood witch it
[52:20 - 52:28] will it will be like it will be red will be like as if it is blood. I'm still going to be like
[52:28 - 52:40] touching this wall, I'll look as though I try to step away when Worth like speaks but yeah I do
[52:42 - 53:36] feel compelled to see I guess what happens next. I think I want to do that
[53:37 - 54:00] what do we endure a cult does this have the bonus no okay let's venture it up
[54:00 - 55:40] and difficulty kill I guess I guess what I'm trying to do is I'm effectively
[55:40 - 55:45] trying to push past whatever this is I'm trying to find out what what is speaking
[55:45 - 55:53] and why it is speaking say if you'll be if your bees can help by you know
[55:53 - 56:00] throw well um yeah I mean I guess that's the question like are you are you
[56:00 - 56:05] attempting to help Arcadia like you know withstand this interaction or are you
[56:05 - 57:07] trying to pull her away from it and I just remembered I feel like this is a
[57:07 - 57:18] time I think I'm gonna use my resistance here as a mind resistance because it
[57:18 - 57:32] seems like this is appropriate. Where'd that thing go? What is the NAM results?
[57:32 - 1:00:37] Is that a cost? Yeah only one so yeah so it's just the one yeah but that's
[1:00:37 - 1:00:48] typical. I think probably at the point where I mean I you know like maybe that
[1:00:48 - 1:00:53] that was it's like tactic but I think at the point where it starts describing
[1:00:53 - 1:02:14] in-depth like the dream would probably be where Arcadia breaks with it like
[1:02:14 - 1:02:21] Arcadia is just going to be I guess not even looking at the like the scrolled
[1:02:21 - 1:02:27] out reply and the and the dream but more like the sort of faded words of the
[1:02:27 - 1:02:32] letter and she's gonna like kind of places a place a hand inside it like a
[1:02:32 - 1:02:46] a coat and close her eyes and just like steal herself for a moment and then
[1:02:46 - 1:02:58] look sharply over at worth and say whatever this presence is it is trying
[1:02:58 - 1:03:37] to defend itself. It wants to compel us to return to silence. You are quick to
[1:03:37 - 1:04:40] assume that it compels out of malice. Go on! Like I will say that the the like the
[1:04:40 - 1:04:49] words that you guys like the letter it is a very personal letter yeah it's it
[1:04:49 - 1:04:57] It is very clearly a letter between two people that knew each other very well and the kind
[1:04:57 - 1:06:09] of thing that you would not just crawl on a wall.
[1:06:09 - 1:06:23] I'm gonna say probably not, the name at the top is not Arcadia's name but you did see
[1:06:23 - 1:06:29] like it looks like it's like a nickname or like a designation but
[1:06:29 - 1:06:58] you did see Arcadia like react to the words. Well I didn't think I'd, yeah alright
[1:06:58 - 1:08:01] I'll have some homework to do I suppose. Well also I think it's very hard for us
[1:08:01 - 1:08:05] to tell when we're scaling because we have to do a lot of
[1:08:05 - 1:09:13] eyebrow work. I guess everybody would have seen the bit about the butcher
[1:09:13 - 1:10:06] bird and the ladder and yeah look I think I like I yeah Arcadia when you
[1:10:06 - 1:10:12] first like when you this morning a week ago when you interrupted Arcadia's
[1:10:12 - 1:10:18] thoughts like she was telling herself roots go down leaves go up but like it
[1:10:18 - 1:10:25] seemed a bit more like a you know a note to sell for a reminder than anything
[1:10:25 - 1:10:30] thing because yes she very much had just had a dream where that was not the case
[1:10:30 - 1:14:17] yes yeah it was not me although um where did where exactly did the sound come
[1:14:17 - 1:15:55] from with that you know because Arcadia did feel like she was being
[1:15:55 - 1:16:04] admonished somewhat she will it's it's you know it's a mirthless kind of smile
[1:16:04 - 1:16:11] like almost a smirk in worth's direction then suck it you're in you're in here with us too
[1:16:56 - 1:18:13] uh does this still feel like an just an occult place um it's interesting like what kind of a
[1:18:14 - 1:18:36] like skeleton does it look like yeah and they got rib cages for days um
[1:18:36 - 1:21:18] Nothing on this scale, have you? Well, better to brave it together than alone, yes?
[1:21:18 - 1:27:44] I know, like, I will, yeah, like, say that to worth, but as I follow along, yeah. Mm-hmm.
[1:27:44 - 1:28:10] So it has, yeah, so it's obvious it has seen us, yes? Uh, given that this was a
[1:28:10 - 1:28:22] heart dream I am going to step past Fesia and you know like get lock eyes
[1:28:22 - 1:29:09] with this thing and hold its gaze as I step forward. I have seen you before
[1:29:09 - 1:31:13] have you seen me? Well you know probably in that case if the heart wanted this
[1:31:13 - 1:31:27] conflict then it makes sense that I would slip into true form but I'm not
[1:31:27 - 1:31:33] I'm not entirely sure that the rest of you would have seen this before depending
[1:31:33 - 1:35:23] on what we've encountered but let's say for fun that you haven't yeah um yes I
[1:35:23 - 1:35:30] guess you guys are just seeing like a kind of like typically ashen skin turn
[1:35:30 - 1:35:38] like jet black and it's it's like these like all these like like hundreds of
[1:35:38 - 1:35:44] thousands of little like you know I guess almost like worming things kind of
[1:35:44 - 1:35:53] burst from her skin and she is instantly this like shadowy beast with you know
[1:35:53 - 1:36:00] kind of horns and sharp jutting bones and like it's, I mean Thessia is probably
[1:36:00 - 1:36:12] like fascinated by it but it is terrifying at the same time. She kind of
[1:36:12 - 1:36:17] weighs, I guess it sort of takes a moment to judge the birds, like dissent
[1:36:17 - 1:36:24] upon them and I think she's basically just gonna launch herself at it when it
[1:36:24 - 1:37:05] gets within range I do have a I do have a blade kill well both is good and then
[1:37:05 - 1:40:23] I've got mastery yeah yeah I think that worked and then follow up
[1:40:23 - 1:40:46] well I'm fighting this thing okay um I mean like I'm probably just want to try
[1:40:46 - 1:40:54] and stab it again um like this is probably just a fair bit of like fury going on at this point
[1:40:56 - 1:41:06] uh so let's let's hopefully roll slightly better than that time uh what do we got
[1:41:08 - 1:41:14] i know what looks like let's let's do a cult domain because that's better
[1:41:16 - 1:41:24] uh why is that going for this oh is that because i didn't do the right thing though
[1:41:24 - 1:41:28] Why did I have three? Why did I have four die at that time and only three last time?
[1:41:28 - 1:41:40] Oh I don't know why it did come. I don't know what the compel
[1:41:40 - 1:41:44] I don't know what the compel dice is therefore I might have clicked the wrong
[1:41:44 - 1:41:59] thing. I have a tag that I'm not quite sure
[1:41:59 - 1:42:08] what the tag is. I mean I've already got I've already got it so I guess it
[1:42:08 - 1:42:13] doesn't really matter. That's what the the true form gives me
[1:42:13 - 1:42:21] mastery anyway so. Oh good so yeah so just roll d6 but that
[1:42:21 - 1:50:52] stupid bird if it yeah if it's only if it's like
[1:50:52 - 1:50:57] landed like i think the target would be one of those wings
[1:50:57 - 1:51:01] um i mean clearly it's it's it's got a little bit of magic buff if like half
[1:51:01 - 1:51:06] of it is rusted anyways but um arkady is looking to ground this thing
[1:51:06 - 1:51:12] rather permanently
[1:51:12 - 1:53:20] again we got oh god
[1:57:41 - 2:00:25] hey hedge is it well there you go
[2:00:26 - 2:00:32] ah well i mean again as as you guys would have seen this like this
[2:00:32 - 2:00:37] form of arcadia is like like flickers as if it's not quite
[2:00:37 - 2:00:42] set in reality and when she moves it's like the frames are missing.
[2:00:45 - 2:00:54] If the bird is kind of falling dead at my feet, I reckon I'm probably going to be plucking that
[2:00:54 - 2:01:17] heart out of its chest. I imagine it's sitting in there, held at the hand of what you know to be
[2:01:17 - 2:01:28] Arcadia you can probably try and take it if you want if they'll if the little
[2:01:28 - 2:01:49] yeah yeah I mean I think there's probably like a split second where like
[2:01:49 - 2:01:56] Arcadia is like like you know head turns and locks eyes with you but at the same
[2:01:56 - 2:02:01] time it it like kind of snaps back to be focused entirely on this this thing that
[2:02:01 - 2:03:34] she's holding yep hmm I mean I guess it's probably more like maybe like given
[2:03:34 - 2:03:40] Fessia has pested Arcadia over what they saw and like the thing changing from one thing to the
[2:03:40 - 2:03:46] other probably like the entire time that she's known her and Arcadia has been cagey at best.
[2:03:49 - 2:04:02] You now maybe understand why I'm like um yeah I guess I'm holding this bird heart in my hand
[2:04:02 - 2:06:40] um yeah i mean um i think that i think that works um uh
[2:06:40 - 2:06:44] i think i've also like let's let's lean into that and i think i would like to
[2:06:44 - 2:06:56] um use my my ramble weird um ability
[2:06:56 - 2:07:00] um given this is this is a pretty weird situation pretty cursed situation for
[2:07:00 - 2:07:04] everybody um to remove d6 stress from
[2:07:04 - 2:07:24] resistances of my choice so I believe that means multiple if I roll well enough. I think it's
[2:07:24 - 2:13:08] probably now it's cursed. You know a younger Arcadia would have because then she would have
[2:13:08 - 2:13:21] got all the birds memories but yeah I mean I guess I'm like I am kind of studying this heart as if
[2:13:21 - 2:13:31] like there might be some answer as to why you know the heart sent me this down this way
[2:13:31 - 2:17:50] to deal with this thing. I would say that if you pass it to Arcadia
[2:17:50 - 2:18:00] like to help you get back down she would again you know check it like in
[2:18:00 - 2:18:08] a way that demonstrates that she is familiar like with how these weapons
[2:18:08 - 2:18:18] work and you know with with with um yeah like not not just from your early but perhaps some skill
[2:19:19 - 2:19:35] yeah well i mean you've already you've already rolled it out and you did kill the bird there you
[2:19:35 - 2:21:14] go jesus wolf hey guys oh yes this place this place here right here yes cursed do you ask
[2:21:14 - 2:21:55] that of your own nature worth, whatever helps you sleep worth. I have sworn to protect you Anthesia
[2:21:55 - 2:22:03] whilst we travel through this heart and within my power I will hold to that.
[2:23:10 - 2:23:13] And they'll be like a little satchel or something.
[2:23:13 - 2:25:04] Yeah I mean if if no one's particularly interrogating okay I'm
[2:25:04 - 2:26:18] probably more just studying that tree at this point. I did yeah no yeah like it's
[2:26:18 - 2:26:23] sort of it's sort of like as I was like holding that that um butcher bird heart
[2:26:23 - 2:26:44] like everything sort of seemed to calm down. Yeah I mean I guess given that
[2:26:44 - 2:26:51] we're out at this you know we've seen this bird we've got this tree um
[2:26:51 - 2:26:55] if i if i reach out i suppose like worth has been climbing all over the tree but
[2:26:55 - 2:28:06] if i reach out and touch the tree does everything happen
[2:28:06 - 2:28:27] i do not i just i i i do not feel anything i thought
[2:28:27 - 2:28:33] i don't know why i would dream this place if it meant
[2:28:33 - 2:30:45] nothing it would have killed us do you keep an open mind left
[2:30:45 - 2:31:31] that is not the same broken like an elf here
[2:31:31 - 2:31:37] and probably okay at this point is just looking at you like
[2:31:37 - 2:31:40] you're not quite quite sure what she's thinking but it's
[2:31:40 - 2:31:43] unnerving the way she's looking like she kind of keeps like
[2:31:43 - 2:32:16] turning her head a little as if to try and like see you from a different angle
[2:32:16 - 2:32:23] well we can see your eyes can't we otherwise what is the point of all that eyebrow work
[2:32:27 - 2:32:39] uh yeah i mean i kind of because you're staring at the rock um yeah uh yeah i mean i can probably
[2:32:39 - 2:32:45] again hold holds the gaze for like a moment or two longer than is comfortable uh before
[2:32:45 - 2:32:55] snapping back to i guess like back to where we came and says well we have cleared the way
[2:32:55 - 2:37:39] we should continue. I feel like I was riding it pretty close.
